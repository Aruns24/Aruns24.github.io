    <h2>Retirement</h2>
    <p>Dhoni announced his retirement from International Test Cricket on 30 December 2014 following the drawn test between India and Australia in Melbourne. The reason that he cited behind his immediate retirement was the strain of playing cricket in all the formats of the game. He also expressed his desire to concentrate better on ODIs and T-20 matches. However, on 04 January 2017, he stepped down from the position of captain of the Indian ODI and T20I cricket teams, though reportedly he had informed the board about his availability for selection for the upcoming series against England during that time.</p>
